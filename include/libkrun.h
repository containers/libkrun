/**
 * Adds a disk image to be used as a general partition for the microVM. The supported

 *
 * This API is mutually exclusive with the deprecated krun_set_root_disk and
 * krun_set_data_disk methods and must not be used together.
 *
 * SECURITY NOTE:
 * Non-Raw images can reference other files, which libkrun will automatically open, and to which the
 * guest will have access. Libkrun should therefore never be asked to open an image in a non-Raw
 * format when it doesn't come from a fully trustworthy source.
 *
 * Consequently, probing an image's format is quite dangerous and to be avoided if at all possible,
 * which is why libkrun provides no facilities for doing so. If it's not clear what format an image
 * has, it may also not be clear whether it can be trusted to not reference files to which the guest
 * shouldn't have access.
 *
 * If probing absolutely can't be avoided, it must only be done on images that are fully trusted, i.e.
 * before a potentially untrusted guest had write access to it. Specifically, consider that a guest has
 * full access to all of a Raw image, and can therefore turn it into a file in an arbitrary format, for
 * example, into a Qcow2 image, referencing and granting a malicious guest access to arbitrary files.
 * To hand a Raw image to an untrusted and potentially malicious guest, and then to re-probe it after
 * the guest was able to write to it (when it can no longer be trusted), would therefore be a severe
 * security vulnerability.
 *
 * Therefore, after having probed a yet fully trusted image once, the result must be remembered so the
 * image will from then on always be opened in the format that was detected originally. When adhering
 * to this, a guest can write anything they want to a Raw image, it's always going to be opened as a
 * Raw image, preventing the security vulnerability outlined above.
 *
 * However, if at all possible, the image format should be explicitly selected based on knowledge
 * obtained separately from the pure image data, for example by the user.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *  "ctx_id"      - the configuration context ID.
 *  "block_id"    - a null-terminated string representing the partition.

 *                  write permissions (for disk images in /usr/share).
 *
 * Returns:
 *  Zero on success or a negative error number on failure.
